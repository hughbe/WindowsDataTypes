/// [MS-DTYP] 2.3 Common Data Structures

/// [MS-DTYP] 2.3.2 EVENT_HEADER
/// The EVENT_HEADER structure defines the main parameters of an event.

/// The KernelTime and UserTime members can be used to determine the CPU cost in units for a set of
/// instructions (the values indicate the CPU usage charged to that thread at the time of logging). For
/// example, if Event A and Event B are consecutively logged by the same thread and they have CPU
/// usage numbers 150 and 175, then the activity that was performed by that thread between events A
/// and B cost 25 CPU time units (175 â€“ 150).
